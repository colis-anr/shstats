#+TITLE: =shstats= --  A statistical analyzer for corpora of shell scripts

* Installing

Shstats depends on morbig >= 0.10.0

A simple =make= should work.

* Example

On a corpus of debian packages:

: find corpus -iregex '.*/\(pre\|post\)\(inst\|rm\)' \
:     | bin/shstats --specifications share/specifications --report-path report

should do the trick. You can then open =report/index.org= in any editor
(although Emacs is recommended as it has a nice support for Org
files).
